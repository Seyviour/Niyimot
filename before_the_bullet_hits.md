Before the Bullet Hits
______________________

This world is a beautiful place  
These Crimson coloured grounds  
They inspire hope  
  
Yes, I see you have a gun  
But I'd wager you don't know to use it  

Oh now, you have it pointed at me  
But what's to say it's actually loaded  
  
Pulling the trigger now, are we? 
I bet that bulle...
