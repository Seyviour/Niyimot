Before the Bullet Hits
______________________


Flutters and flowers are all I desire
Rainbows and rivers for my eyes to admire
A hand in mine and the pulse of another
A moment for now a memory forever



I choose to be grateful


Never mind the dirt
The fires and the pyres
Red is beautiful too
I like the dance of the flames


Chaos is beautiful too
All laid bare in the quest for survival
All love here is it at its truest|finest
All hate here is simply necessity



This world is a beautiful place  
These Crimson coloured grounds  
They inspire hope 

Death must be beautiful too 


Yes, I see you have a gun  
But I'd wager you don't know to use it  

Oh now, you have it pointed at me  
But what's to say it's actually loaded  
  
Pulling the trigger now, are we? 
I bet that bulle...
