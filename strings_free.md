# Peace  

Am I a fool to want my hands  
To want my eyes and want my soul
To see the seas and praise the skies 


First the paper and then the silk 

Will I be free if I rip his strings
The strings of paper and those of flame


Of the puppet master and his master
And his master and his master


Am I a fool to want for freedom  
To walk the earth and hold your hands  


Allow me to savour my pleasures  
To savour my pleasures and earn my pain




Allow me to rip his strings  
The strings of paper and those of silk


As this monster reveals its form  
And the sweet songs drown the teara  
Whisper in my ears that I'm no fool  
To draw my sword and face this beast  

Unsure as I am of what may be
I need you to tell me I'm not the monster
I know that I'm no hero
But please tell me I'm not the monster
