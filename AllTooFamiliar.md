# ALL TOO FAMILIAR

Discomfort from being the third of four
in a space where only three should be

The stench of the I have to walk through
to get to church on Sundays
of my neighbours soakaway just past the fence

Being called "sir" by people many times older
on the days I have my best clothes on 

The bread I didn't know I liked
My favorite now because it's
